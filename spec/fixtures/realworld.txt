Erika I'm unfortunately in India till the 22nd. I have been involved with the program before but if you think I still need some information, perhaps I can do a quick catchup when I'm back?

<p>Dear Dinesh,</p>
<p>Thank you for volunteering to serve as an advisor in the Founder Board of Advisors Program for this session. In preparation, <b>we ask that you attend an orientation session on Thursday, March 14th, from 7:30 - 8:30pm at the StartX offices</b> so we can update you on all of the program changes. This is also a great opportunity to meet all of the other StartX advisors.</p>
<p>If you can no longer attend the orientation, please email me at <a href="mailto:startx_fba@startx.stanford.edu">startx_fba@startx.stanford.edu</a>. If you have already told me (in the form) that you cannot attend the orientation, then I will reach out to you by email to set up a time to chat.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all of your time and support.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Erika</p>
