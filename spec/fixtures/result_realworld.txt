Erika I'm unfortunately in India till the 22nd. I have been involved with the program before but if you think I still need some information, perhaps I can do a quick catchup when I'm back?

In preparation, **we ask that you attend an orientation session on Thursday, March 14th, from 7:30 - 8:30pm at the StartX offices** so we can update you on all of the program changes. This is also a great opportunity to meet all of the other StartX advisors.
