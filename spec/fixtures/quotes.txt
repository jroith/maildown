My name is Nicolas and I am the CTO of StartX. I have been on the StartX team from the very beginning (Sep 2010), but I have been on a short hiatus finishing my PhD, and that's why you may not remember me.<br><br>

I'm excited to tell you that we have a present for you! StartX recently received hundreds of job applications from the Stanford population, and we would like to use this opportunity to help all of you (alumni and current StartX companies) recruit new employees.<br><br>

If you are interested please guide our recommendations by answering the four questions below asap.  We will be sending you candidates based on your responses in the next month or so.<br><div class="HOEnZb"><div class="h5">

1. Are you currently interested to hire new employees?<br><br>

2. Are you hiring fulltimers, parttimers, Summer interns or a combination?<br><br>

3. Do you plan to pay them, or you can only offer equity?<br><br>

4. Any specific positions you are looking to hire?<br><br><br>

Best,<br>
