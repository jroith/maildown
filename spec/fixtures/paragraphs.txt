<p>Hi Ludwig,</p>
<p>It’s been a few months since the end of the HCI Online class - we hope that the class was useful in giving you a sense of how interface design happens.</p>
<p>For the class, we launched some experimental, social features, and thanks for signing up for them! As we’re considering including them in the next run on the HCI Online class, we wanted to find out what you thought.</p>
<p>We showed you friends who were also taking the class and also assignments that they worked on - what did you think, and how could those interactions have been improved?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon! <br>
Ludwig<br></p></p>
